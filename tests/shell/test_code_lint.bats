# --- No _for_testing methods in production code ---

# See commit removing these for the migration pattern.
#
# *_mock.h files are explicitly excluded: mocks ARE test infrastructure (the
# whole class exists only for tests), so a `_for_testing` setter on a mock
# carries no risk of shipping test code to users — the mock itself is gated
# by HELIX_ENABLE_MOCKS and never enters production builds.

# --- Migrated temperature VIEW files must route sends through the controller ---
# ui_overlay_temp_graph.cpp and ui_panel_controls.cpp were migrated to delegate
# temperature commands to helix::TemperatureController. They must NOT call the
# raw send API directly again — that would reintroduce the duplication the
# refactor removed. A direct send is either `api_->set_temperature(` or any
# `->set_temperature(` whose receiver is not a `controller`.

# --- Chamber temp_display must use the maintain-aware effective target ---
# The raw `chamber_target` subject is the heater target only — it reads 0 during
# M141 "maintain" (cooling-ceiling) mode, so a display bound to it shows "—/Off"
# while the chamber is actually holding a setpoint. All chamber temp_display
# instances must bind to `chamber_effective_target` (+ `chamber_mode`), never the
# raw subject. (Drip-fixed missed-spot class; see chamber M141 routing work.)
