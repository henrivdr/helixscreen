# Tests for helix-launcher.sh boot-time respawn self-heal.
#
# Background: some firmwares (notably the Snapmaker U1 on Paxx Extended 1.4)
# send helix-screen a single SIGTERM during the busy boot sequence. helix-screen
# handles SIGTERM with a fast _exit(0) (see graceful_quit_signal_handler),
# expecting a supervisor to respawn it. The U1 ships NO helix-watchdog and
# busybox SysV init does not respawn S99 children, so that one signal is
# permanent — and because helix-screen owns the WiFi association on the U1, its
# death leaves the device dark AND off-network (unreachable).
#
# The launcher therefore self-heals: if helix-screen exits very quickly after
# launch (uptime < window — i.e. it never became interactive), it is respawned
# up to HELIX_BOOT_RESPAWN_MAX times. A clean exit AFTER a normal run (uptime >=
# window) is treated as a deliberate quit and is NOT respawned. The feature is
# OFF by default (MAX=0) so supervised platforms are unchanged; the U1 platform
# hook opts in.
