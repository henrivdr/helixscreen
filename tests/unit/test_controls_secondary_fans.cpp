 * @file test_controls_secondary_fans.cpp
 * @brief Design-conformance regression test for ControlsPanel secondary-fan
 *        SubjectLifetime handling (lesson L084 / L077).
 *
 * ControlsPanel::subscribe_to_secondary_fan_speeds() observes the per-fan speed
 * subjects returned by PrinterState::get_fan_speed_subject(name, lifetime). Those
 * subjects are DYNAMIC — freed and recreated whenever fans are re-discovered. The
 * mandatory doctrine is that each observer's SubjectLifetime token must live in a
 * *member* vector (secondary_fan_lifetimes_) that outlives the paired ObserverGuard
 * (secondary_fan_observers_), aligned index-for-index. A stack-local token would
 * expire the guard's weak_ptr immediately, leaving a dangling observer that
 * corrupts the subject's observer list on later teardown.
 *
 * This test locks that in:
 *  - The panel retains a live shared_ptr COPY of each fan's lifetime token in a
 *    member vector aligned with its observers (only a member — not a stack local —
 *    can do this). This test does not even *compile* against the old stack-local
 *    design, because there is no member vector to inspect.
 *  - When the fans are re-discovered and the generic fans are orphaned, each
 *    retained token flips to false (subject death signalled), which the panel can
 *    only observe because it holds a live copy.
 *  - The real teardown/rebuild path (populate_secondary_fans) runs without crashing
 *    even though it resets ObserverGuards whose subjects were already freed —
 *    ObserverGuard::reset() must skip lv_observer_remove() on the dead subjects.
