## Recently Completed

### XML Engine Extraction & LVGL 9.5 Upgrade ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-18

Extracted the LVGL XML engine into standalone `lib/helix-xml/` library and upgraded LVGL from 9.4-pre to v9.5.0, gaining 274 commits of improvements (blur, drop shadow, flex rounding fixes, memory leak fixes, gesture threshold API, slot support). XML patches baked permanently into helix-xml; LVGL patches regenerated for v9.5. New umbrella headers (`helix_xml.h`), standalone globals, and forward declaration files decouple helix-xml from LVGL internals.

**Branch:** `feature/helix-xml` | **Plan:** `docs/devel/plans/2026-02-18-helix-xml-plan.md`

### Power Panel Integration ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-18

Home panel quick-toggle button for power devices (tap to toggle, long-press for full panel), Advanced panel entry with conditional visibility via `power_device_count` capability subject, device selection chips for choosing which devices the home button controls, and auto-discovery of Moonraker power devices on connect.

**Files:** `ui_panel_power.cpp`, `ui_panel_home.cpp`, `printer_capabilities_state.cpp`

### Multi-Unit AMS ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-17

Multi-unit AMS overview panel, shared detail components (DRY refactor), per-slot error visualization with buffer health, AFC/Happy Hare device management overlays, mock backend deduplication via shared defaults modules. Visual verification complete.

**Branch:** `feature/multi-unit-ams` (76 commits, 146 files, +34k/-14k lines)

### Debug Bundle Upload ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Support diagnostics system for remote troubleshooting:
- **Debug bundle collector** gathers logs, crash data, config, and system info
- **Upload to Cloudflare Worker** endpoint for support team access
- **Modal UI** with progress feedback in Settings panel
- 193 unit tests

**Files:** `debug_bundle_collector.cpp`, `ui_debug_bundle_modal.cpp`

### Probe Management Overlay ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-15

Probe configuration and management overlay in Advanced panel:
- **Auto-detection** of probe types: Cartographer, Beacon, Tap, Klicky, BLTouch, eddy current
- **BLTouch panel** with live Z-offset adjustment
- **First-run wizard step** for probe sensor selection
- Hidden when no probe detected

**Files:** `ui_probe_overlay.cpp`, `ui_xml/probe_overlay.xml`, `ui_xml/probe_bltouch_panel.xml`

### Active Extruder Temperature Tracking ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Unified temperature tracking for multi-extruder/multi-tool printers:
- Dynamic nozzle label showing active tool number
- `PrinterTemperatureState` tracks active extruder across tool changes
- Integrated with LED auto-state and telemetry

### Z-Axis Direction Flip Toggle ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-15

Settings option to invert Z movement buttons for printers where the auto-detection heuristic gets it wrong.

### Hardware Discovery Improvements ✅
**Completed:** 2026-02-16

Skip expected hardware in new discovery check — reduces false-positive "new hardware detected" prompts after initial wizard setup.

## Current Priorities

### 1. Plugin Ecosystem

**Status:** Core infrastructure complete, expanding ecosystem

The plugin system launched with version checking, UI injection points, and async execution.

**Next steps:**
- [ ] LED Effects plugin → production quality
- [ ] Additional plugin examples for community
- [ ] Plugin documentation refinement

**Files:** `src/plugin_manager.cpp`, `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md`

### 2. Production Hardening

**1.0 hardening audit completed 2026-03-28.** 22 items fixed across crash safety, network resilience, config robustness, SHA256 update verification, comprehensive i18n (218 strings wrapped in lv_tr()), UI consistency, and test quality. See git history for details.

Remaining items for production readiness:
- [x] Structured logging with log rotation
- [ ] Streaming file operations verified on AD5M with 50MB+ G-code files

## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Effort | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Camera/Webcam** | Low | Lower priority for local touchscreen use case |
| **Belt tension visualization** | Future | Accelerometer-based CoreXY belt comparison; reuses frequency chart |
| **OTA updates** | Future | UpdateChecker downloads + installs; needs auto-apply without user interaction |
| ~~Update hash verification~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✅ Done — SHA256 verified from R2 manifest before install, graceful skip on GitHub fallback |
| **Pre-migration config backup** | Low | Snapshot config before running versioned migrations, cleanup on success |
| **Printer DB schema validation** | Low | Validate required fields in printer_database.json entries, detect duplicate IDs |
| **Text overflow audit** | Medium | 226/282 XML files lack truncation/wrapping for long translated strings |
| **Breakpoint coverage** | Medium | Only ~10 XML files implement responsive breakpoints; expand to more panels |
| **UI test coverage** | High | 13% coverage (34/257 src files tested); add panel interaction tests |
| **Power consumption display** | Medium | Tasmota/Mainsail-style energy monitoring: voltage, current, power, energy usage for power devices |
| **Plugin system tests** | Medium | Only mock tests exist; add real plugin load/unload/injection tests |
| **Error-path integration tests** | High | Disconnect mid-print, settings corruption recovery, AMS hardware desync |
| **Remove libinput dependency** | Medium | Refactor to use direct evdev for all input; eliminates libinput build/link complexity across cross-compile targets |
| **Missing docs** | Medium | SENSOR_MANAGEMENT, GCODE_RENDERING_ARCHITECTURE, ACTION_PROMPTS, BLUETOOTH_SYSTEM, USB_MANAGEMENT |

See `docs/devel/IDEAS.md` for additional ideas and design rationale.

## Known Technical Debt

See `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DEBT.md` for the full register.

**Resolved (2026-01):**
- ~~PrinterState god class~~ → Decomposed into 13 domain classes
- ~~PrintStatusPanel~~ → Extracted 8 focused components
- ~~SettingsPanel~~ → Extracted 5 overlay components

**Remaining:**
- **Application class** (1249 lines) → Extract bootstrapper and runtime
- **Singleton cascade pattern** → UIPanelContext value object
- **Code duplication** → PanelBase/OverlayBase with RAII subjects (complete)
- **NavigationManager intimacy** → Extract INavigable interface

**Deferred past 1.0 (known, accepted):**
- **God classes** (Application 3.3K LOC, AmsState 3.5K LOC, ThemeManager 3.6K LOC) — real debt, but refactoring pre-1.0 is high risk for regressions. They work.
- **Recursive mutex in AmsState** — ugly pattern but functional with current usage.
- **Shutdown flag races** — theoretical window, mitigated by alive guards in practice.
- **UpdateQueue frozen TOCTOU** — the frozen flag is a safety net that works "well enough"; fixing it is fiddly atomic work for marginal gain.
- **Static subject lifecycle** — documented, understood, tested.

**Planned post-1.0 refactoring (active intent, not yet scheduled):**
- **Dynamic overlay allocation** — migrate existing `ui_overlay_*` and `ui_settings_*` files from the `get_global_*()` + `init_global_*()` singleton pattern to on-demand construction with destroy-on-pop ownership held by NavigationManager. Saves memory on small devices (AD5M 14–20MB budget) and unblocks multi-instantiation. Mechanism unresolved: destroy-on-pop vs memory-pressure eviction, NavigationManager API changes, per-instance event callback adapter pattern. New overlays should not use the singleton pattern; see `YOUR_FIRST_CONTRIBUTION.md` § "Going forward: dynamic overlays".

## Design Philosophy

HelixScreen is a **local touchscreen** UI - users are physically present at the printer. This fundamentally differs from web UIs (Mainsail/Fluidd) designed for remote monitoring.

**We prioritize:**
- Tactile controls optimized for touch
- At-a-glance information for the user standing at the machine
- Calibration workflows (PID, Z-offset, screws tilt, input shaper)
- Real-time tuning (speed, flow, firmware retraction)

**Lower priority for this form factor:**
- Camera (you can see the printer with your eyes)
- Job queue (requires manual print removal between jobs)
- System stats (CPU/memory) — not diagnosing remote issues
- Remote access/monitoring features

Don't copy features from web UIs just because "competitors have it" — evaluate whether it makes sense for a local touchscreen.
