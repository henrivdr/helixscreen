/// Two input paths feed in:
///   1. Live `notify_gcode_response` broadcast — fires once per event.
///   2. `server.gcode_store` replay on (re)connect — catches errors that
///      fired while HelixScreen was offline (broken boot autostart, crash
///      recovery, WebSocket bounce). Without this, reconnecting to a
///      paused printer shows no error context; the chinglish stays buried
///      in klippy.log.
///
/// Translation: `!! {"code":"key849",...}` → `CfsErrorDecoder` →
/// "Retract failed — filament stuck in connector in unit 1 slot A.
///  Manually pull the filament back through the connector".
///
/// Routing:
///   - `key8xx` (CFS hardware) → modal "Filament System Error"
///   - `key298` (MCU bridge)   → toast with "Recover" action
///   - other `!!`              → deferred toast (RPC-correlation dedup)
///   - `Error:` lines          → toast
///   - replay path             → modal (the user was disconnected; a
///                                transient toast they can miss is not
///                                enough on first reconnect)
